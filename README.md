# TopicSphere

## Description

**TopicSphere** is a platform designed to manage and explore topics of interest, featuring both a backend service and a frontend interface. The project leverages the functionality of two repositories to provide a complete solution for topic management:

The repository is organized into two primary components:

- **`LIREDDIT-SERVER`**: Contains the backend code, including API endpoints and data management logic.
- **`lireddit-web`**: Contains the frontend code, providing the user interface and interaction with the backend services.
  
## Features

### Backend Features
- **API Endpoints**: Handles CRUD operations for topics.
- **Data Management**: Manages storage and retrieval of topic-related data.
- **User Authentication**: Supports user registration and login.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Provides real-time updates to the frontend.

### Frontend Features
- **Dynamic User Interface**: Interactive UI for exploring and managing topics.
- **Real-Time Data Display**: Updates reflect changes from the backend instantly.
- **Responsive Design**: Accessible and functional across various devices and screen sizes.
